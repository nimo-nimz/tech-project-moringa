			<h1>Living like you mean it. Be deliberate</h1>
			<p>
				This is my very first website focusing on living deliebrately and choosing joy. ost people claim they want to live more fulfilling lives but when you ask them what they are doing to make their actions come to life, they excuses begin. Too little time. Not enough money. Not the right time. Not the right body type. Etc. etc. Literally there are thousands of excuses people will come up with as to why they are not living their ideal lives.
